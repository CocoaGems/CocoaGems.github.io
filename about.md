	<p class=”intro”>CocoaGems is the Rails Girls Summer of Code (RGSoC) team of Emma Koszinowski and Karla Sandoval.<a href=”railsgirlssummerofcode.org”>Rails Girls Summer of Code</a> is a not-for-profit organization that provides global fellowships for women committed to developing Ruby and Rails skills by working on an Open Source project from July-September. To submit our applications we had to:

1.Find a team-mate
2.Select an Approved Open Source Project Proposal
3.Find 2 coaches willing to spend at least 2 hrs a day working with us.
4.Find a Workspace or Coaching Company</p>

<p>After selecting an Open Source project from the projects proposals in RSGoC we came up with our team name<a=href”http://cocoagems.github.io/about”>Cocoagems</a>. Our team name Cocoagems is a tribute to <a href=”http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html”>CocoaPods </a>and one that we came up with when we decided to apply to work on the Open Source  CocoaPods project. Cocoapods is a dependency manager for IOS. Our CocoaPods mentors include Samuel Giddins, Orta Therox, Kyle Fuller and Boris Bugling. CocoaPods is a marriage of the iOS and the Ruby and Rails Communities. We are both committed to growing our skills in both iOS and Ruby.
