<p>	<a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org">Rails Girls Summer of Code</a> is a not-for-profit organization that provides three month long fellowships globally to diversify Open Source Software. Rails Girls Summer of Code is in its third year and it is one of the very few programs focused on helping teams develop programming skills, learn hands on with coaches and mentors and while working on an open source project. In addition to contributing to real software production RGSoC provides a stipend to participating teams to offset living costs throughout the program. Programming apprenticeships and fellowships are pretty rare and the opportunity to receive a scholarship while learning instead of having to pay to learn is rare  given the hefty price of bootcamps. RGSoC aims to bring more women into open source and  is changing the low numbers of female to males in software development. During RGSoC teams get to develop connections with coaches and mentors throughout the summer. Participants can also expect to develop more familiarity with the code base of their open source project of choice and to expand their network tremendously.</p>


<p>After selecting an Open Source project from the projects proposals in RSGoC we came up with our team name <a href="http://cocoagems.github.io/contact">Cocoagems</a>. Our team name Cocoagems is a tribute to the <a href="https://cocoapods.org/">CocoaPods </a> and one that we came up with when we decided to apply to work on the Open Source  CocoaPods dependency manager for iOS development. After selecting an Open Source project to work on we reached out to Github for co-working space and the possibility that they might have coaches interested in learning more about CocoaPods and teaching development. Github responded generously  with not two but five coaches. As if that were not uber generous already they are also hosting us at their Headquarters in San Francisco and providing us with co-working space and amazing hospitality.</p>



<p>Our team wants to give a special thanks to Rails Girl Summer of Code, to CocoaPods and to Github for all of your support and enthusiasm expressed to our team. Our Github coaches: Rachel Myers, Jese Toth, Ross McFarland, Jake Boxer and Rob Rix have been fantastic. And our CocoaPods mentors include Kyle Fuller, Orta Therox, Samuel Giddins and Boris Bügling. Our external coaches are Nevyn Bengtsson, co-founder at <a href="https://lookback.io/">Lookback</a>, and Sean Mackesey.</p>
