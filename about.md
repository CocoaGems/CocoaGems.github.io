	<p class=”intro”>CocoaGems is the Rails Girls Summer of Code (RGSoC) team of Emma Koszinowski and Karla Sandoval.<a href=”railsgirlssummerofcode.org”>Rails Girls Summer of Code</a> is a not-for-profit organization that provides global fellowships for women committed to developing Ruby and Rails skills by working on an Open Source project from July-September. To be considered for RGSoC we had to:

<p><ul>1.Find a team-mate</ol>
<ol>2. Select an Approved Open Source Project Proposal</ol>
<ol>3. Find a minimum of 2 coaches who can coach us for 1-2 hrs/day .</ol>
<ol>4. Find a Workspace or Coaching Company</ol></p>

<p>After selecting an Open Source project from the projects proposals in RSGoC we came up with our team name <a=href”http://cocoagems.github.io/about”>Cocoagems</a>. Our team name Cocoagems is a tribute to <a href=”http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html”>CocoaPods </a>and one that we came up with when we decided to apply to work on the Open Source  CocoaPods project. Cocoapods is a dependency manager for IOS . Our CocoaPods mentors include Samuel Giddins, Orta Therox, Kyle Fuller and Boris Bugling. CocoaPods is a marriage of the iOS and the Ruby and Rails Communities. We are both committed to growing our skills in both iOS and Ruby.
