title: "Who Is Team CocoaGems?"

---


<p class="intro">CocoaGems is the name of our Rails Girls Summer of Code (RGSoC) team. Emma Koszinowski and  Karla Sandoval met at a Women Who Code, Python Study Night back in February. Soon after we began trading tech Meetup invites and attending the same <a href="https://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/san-franciscoGirl"> Develop It workshops</a>. Our commitment to learn how to code was mutual. We met at coffee shops to work on tutorials weekly, motivated each other. Soon after we applied to RGSoC. With only two weeks left till application due dates we began the application journey.</p>


<p>	<a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org">Rails Girls Summer of Code</a> is a not-for-profit organization that provides three month long fellowships globally to diversify Open Source Software. Rails Girls Summer of Code is in its third year and it is one of the very few programs focused on helping teams develop programming skills while working on an open source project. In addition to contributing to real software production RGSoC provides teams a stipend  to offset living costs throughout the program.  RGSoC aims to bring more women into open source and is changing the skewed ratios of female to males in tech. During RGSoC, teams develop connections with coaches and mentors and become more familiar with the code base of their open source project.</p>


<p> Our team name <a href="http://cocoagems.github.io/contact">Cocoagems</a> is a tribute to <a href="https://cocoapods.org/">CocoaPods </a>. CocoaPods is an Open Source dependency manager used for iOS development. After selecting an Open Source project to work on we reached out to Github. We were looking for co-working space and the possibility that they might have Engineers interested in coaching. Github responded generously  with not two but five coaches. As if that were not uber generous, they are also hosting us at their Headquarters in San Francisco and providing us with co-working space and amazing hospitality.</p>


<p>Our team  is made up more than us two. It includes our Github coaches: Rachel Myers, Jese Toth, Ross McFarland, Jake Boxer and Rob Rix. Our CocoaPods mentors: Kyle Fuller, Orta Therox, Samuel Giddins and Boris BÃ¼gling. Our external coaches  Nevyn Bengtsson, co-founder at <a href="https://lookback.io/">Lookback</a> and Sean Mackesey- UC Berkeley.
Thank you Rails Girl Summer of Code, CocoaPods and Github for all of your support and enthusiasm. This journey has just begun and it is incredible with you all.
