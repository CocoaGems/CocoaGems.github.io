	<p class="intro">CocoaGems is the Rails Girls Summer of Code (RGSoC) team of Emma Koszinowski and Karla Sandoval. <a href="railsgirlssummerofcode.org">Rails Girls Summer of Code</a> is a not-for-profit organization that a three month long global fellowship to diversify Open Source. In addition to increasing diversity the fellowship Open Source project of choice with coaches and mentors possible by providing students with a monthly stipend to off set some living costs.

	<p> For our application to be considered by RGSoC we had to find an Open Source project, more than two coaches that could help us with coding and preferably a coaching company that could provide work space for us.</p>


<p>After selecting an Open Source project from the projects proposals in RSGoC we came up with our team name <a href="http://cocoagems.github.io/about">Cocoagems</a>. Our team name Cocoagems is a tribute to <a href="http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html">CocoaPods </a>and one that we came up with when we decided to apply to work on the Open Source  CocoaPods project. Cocoapods is a dependency manager for iOS development. We also reached out to Github and they generously responded with not two but five coaches and as if that were not enough they are also hosting us at their HQ in San Francisco and providing us with space to work space and amazing hospitality.</p>



<p>We want to give a special thanks to Rails Girl Summer of Code, to CocoaPods and to Github. Our Github coaches: Rachel Myers, Jese Toth, Ross McFarland, Jake Boxer and Rob Rix. Our CocoaPods mentors include Samuel Giddins, Orta Therox, Kyle Fuller and Boris Bugling. Our external coaches are Nevyn Bengtsson and Sean Mackesey.
