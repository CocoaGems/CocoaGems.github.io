<p class ="intro"><span class="dropcap"></span>Ok So it is September in San Francisco and not quite Summer anymore. Which means that as of today Rails Girls Summer of Code teams have 8 days left until the end of the program. Here is a list of my shiniest and most loved newly acquired skills, revelations and commands:</p>

How do you work on an Open Source Project without a read.me as a newbie? As some of you may know this summer  CocoaGems [include a link to the about.md here] have been working on CocoaPods. The issue I have been working  on this Summer <a href=”https://github.com/CocoaPods/Cork”>Cork</a>  did not contain a read.me. Fortunately, I had mentors and coaches who offered there precious time to work with us. The question that confronted me shortly after choosing to work on Cork is how do you go about getting more background of the Code base while learning Ruby? Git-blame came to the rescue. Git-blame allows you to track down the first person to contribute to the file and also to track every other commit since the first to the most present connecting each one to its author and date. While working on an open source project it is useful to know whom the contributors of each commit are because it makes it a lot easier to ask them questions directly.

Asking questions when you feel like you should already know what you are asking can be pretty uncomfortable. It's the equivalent of feeling like you should know the months of the year but somehow you haven't learned them yet as an adult. To combat the feeling stuck mode, I came up with a technique that worked pretty well. Open up Slack pick a coach, mentor, friend or both and type out your question. Composing a question in a way that someone else can understand requires that you establish what kind of trouble you are having and it gets gets you many steps closer to that answer you are looking for, many times this technique worked so well that I was able to answer my own questions just by putting my question in the Slack UI and thinking about it without hitting send and sometimes after submitting the question and having a few more minutes to let it soak in. And What I found is that I didn’t alway know what my problems was, but by writing it down I was better able to understand what the challenge was.

How to automate your learning process. Is that even possible? learn to schedule meetings with mentors, coaches, colleagues and managers naturally by scheduling one each and every single time after every session. The best resource available for learning aside of the web are definitely our coaches and mentors. I learned to schedule as many sessions with them. Some were in person, some were over screen hero and some of the meetings we scheduled were also with other RGSoC participating teams and or Github Summer of Code students in particular Mark Tareshawty. Google Calendar became my best friend. Adding Meetup events that I wanted to attend and also scheduling a well thought out plan for the day made it so that transitioning from one activity to the next happened with as least cognitive exertion as necessary.

Some of the most interesting frameworks concepts our mentors and coaches introduced us to include writing tests in RSPeC, writing unit tests and how to reduce issues into sub-issues by creating issues on Github and or by using Trello.Testing is definitely a skill to develop since there are ways to write tests that pass but don’t necessarily check what you  may be testing. How to create CHANGELOGS, extract code and determine what to keep and what to get rid of. Refactoring is a new concept Kyle introduced me to and it means getting rid of code. Refactoring is scary at first but makes it easier for other developers to work on code that is easier to read.


The best learning experience gained from working on RGSoC this Summer:
Learning how to learn.

Working on CocoaPods has taught me to reach out for help in places I would not have considered before. Open Source means working with other people, collaboration and sharing. During RGSoC we had many opportunities to ask questions. We used the four Slack channels that we had especially when we were stuck or could no longer work on something on our own. The channels that we were a part of include the Rails Girls Summer of Code, the CocoaPods channel, the Github Summer of Code channel as well as the iOS channel. On occasion, when both coaches and or mentors were busy I  reached out to other students from the Github channel and to other CocoaPods contributors I had not met yet. Participating in this program has made me aware of  the multitude of resources and has improved my ability to ask for help by expanding my comfort zone.


In addition to knowing how and when to reach out for help, to be a good programmer you have to be good at snooping, perusing, reading between the lines, and by that I mean doing some of detective work. Digging deep and knowing how to search is a plus. When documentation is not present or poorly written you have to be able to learn how to piece  background information to  understand how code the code works. The summer was a full on learning experience - it makes me happy to know  that we kept a RGSoC Team Apps journal- this summer has to be the best well spent three months of my life and best use of time. An enormous thank you to our CocoaPods Mentors: Kyle Fuller, Orta Therox, Boris Bugling and Samuel Giddins. To our GithHub coaches: Jake Boxer, Jesse Toth, Rachel Meyers,  Rob Rix and Ross Mc Farland.Learning about software development, fundamentals, Git, algorithms,how to write tests, and Agile has been a great experience with you!!


Releasing our first gem <a href="https://github.com/Karla-Isabel-Sandoval/cocoapods-labelCocoaPods-label">CocoaPods-label</a> with our coach Boris Buegling was one of the best experiences While working on CocoaPods-label he would share his screen when Googling. He taught us how to perform better searches but most importantly it reassured me that no-one knows everything. Regardless of how seasoned, experienced or smart anyone is-- developers use documentation frequently  to either double check or for reference. CocoaPods-label, making my first pull request,learning not to commit to Master were also great experiences.
